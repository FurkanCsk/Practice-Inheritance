# Practice_Inheritance

This project demonstrates the use of inheritance in C# with a simple example involving BasePerson, Teacher, and Student classes.

Project Overview
The project includes three classes:

1. BasePerson: A base class that holds common properties for a person, such as Name and Surname, and a method DisplayInfo to display these properties.

2. Teacher: Inherits from BasePerson and adds an additional property, Salary. It includes two constructors: one for initializing all properties and a default constructor. The DisplayTeacher method displays the teacher's information including salary.

3. Student: Also inherits from BasePerson and adds a property StudentNo. It includes two constructors: one for initializing all properties and a default constructor. The DisplayStudent method displays the student's information including student number.
